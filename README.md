## 📌 Optional Extended Description

> This project was built as a lightweight, offline-capable alternative to online file encryption tools. The goal was to explore cryptographic methods using the Web Crypto API and demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to perform secure file operations directly in the browser.  
> It’s especially useful for students, developers, or users looking for basic file security without any backend/server.
